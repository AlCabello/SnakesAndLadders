This is the game Snakes and Ladders, the project was supposed to be only the dice mechanics and tests about it, but I was so excited, and I make the full game, to implement the dice mechanics better.
I make it in Kotlin because it's the OOP I'm best at, other option is C# but I want to train it more.


If you want to execute the game you need import it into an IDE, I used IntelIJ, but I think it works in all IDE interfaces. Then go to the file MainCode.kt is in src/main/kotlin/game/code, search the function main, and execute it.

Tests are in src/main/kotlin/test.
